# StudySpot
About a year ago I started work on a studying program. It was pretty basic and it stored flashcards as url parameters, but it was useful because I could make the studying tools I needed without having to shell out $20 for Quizlet Plus.

A year ago I was still using jQuery AJAX, among other things, so I knew I had to restart the project with best practices and a better framework from the start.
